                The church "Eglise Bateau de l'Evangile de JÃ©sus Christ" is a community 
                church that opened for service on August 31, 2014. It mainly consists 
                of members of the Haitian community living in Tallahassee.

                Even though we primarily use both the Haitian Creole and French-based 
                languages, we also have teaching, worshiping, and preaching in English 
                for the kids and the youth who do not understand the Haitian Creole 
                and French languages.

                As Christians, worship is central to our life in the church. When we 
                gather for praise and worship services, prayers, and other God-fearing 
                activities in the church, we are reminded of our covenant and relationship 
                with God and the saving work of Jesus Christ.
